# BuildGraphics

## Topic:
Development of a graphical user interface application for numerical finding of the maximum by the Dichotomy method.

## Formulation of the problem:
During the work it is necessary to design and implement a graphical user interface program to numerically find the maximum of the function
`f(x) - g(x) -> max`

The function `f(x)` is a polynomial of nth degree. The values of the function `g(x)` are given by a set of points. For the function `g(x)` it is necessary to perform interpolation using the method of Lagrange polynomials.


It is necessary to implement the following features of the program:
- creating a new data set in the program;
- entering data from an XML document and editing with the ability to store data in another XML document;
- finding the minimum with the display of results and presentation of graphical interpretation;
- generation of a report on the results of the program with the inclusion in the report of a graphical representation of the solution of the problem;
- receiving contextual help.


The user interface provides a window with the main menu, the necessary buttons, tables for entering and editing data, rows for entering scalar data, a text area for displaying results and a panel for displaying graphs, as well as a separate window for contextual help.
