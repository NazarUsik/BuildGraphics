<p><h1>Dichotomy</h1>
<p>In math, dichotomy method allow us to find one and only one root in segment.</p>
<p>In our program, interval was divided into small segments, which were solved using dichotomy method.</p>
<p>Roots in program are approximate, because it's it is necessary from the point of view of optimization
<p>If you need more accurate results, make search ranges smaller
